A description of why I appreciate technology
I love technology for multiple reasons. I am an avid gamer and I greatly appreciate the progess games have made due to newer technology. It's really amazing how it has made our lives so much easier. The most important and what I appreciate the most is the infinite amount of information accessible at any time or place.
